# Topic modeling and homology

This repository contains text and code for a contribution to a volume on the concept of homology in sociology.

> The publication we envision is an edited book with the purpose of discussing the concept of homology and providing exemplary case of how to empirically investigate homological structures and relations. The book will be focus on different forms of homology and all papers should engage with the theoretical introduction. A first draft will be circulated in the early fall. The book, hence, seek to address a sociological audience interested in field theory and interested in developing both the conceptual tool of field theory, its practical application and the usefulness to study new empirical phenomena. I also hope to show the usefulness of the concept and approach to a broader sociological audience, so please also considers how your paper contributes to wider sociological debates. Hence, we are looking for papers that discuss the:

> - Theoretical limitations and possibilities of homology
> - Empirical applications of different forms of homology
> - Focus on the use of homology to understand specific problematics 

>We encourage authors to think about how they can summarize and crystallize earlier research, provide comparative analysis, the limitations of the concept and more general application of the approach suggested. We welcome collaboration and coauthored contributions.
