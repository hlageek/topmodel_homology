## Abstract

This chapter aims to analyze homologies between disciplinary spaces of position-takings within the global framework of virtually all research funded in the Czech Republic over two decades. Our objectives are threefold: *first*, we show how topic modeling suits the homology framework by enabling comparisons of oppositional structures based on topic distributions, with reference to the global space of science as constructed by the donut. *Second*, we emphasize that topic models are of crucial interest when working on semantic structures, especially when combined with geometrical data analysis-in this case, principal component analysis (PCA). To this end, we propose a novel approach, derived from class-specific multiple correspondence analysis, to shed light on the specific distribution of topics-and hence the structure-of disciplinary spaces of position-takings, with reference to the cognitive structure of a global space of science. *Third*, our methodological and empirical work emphasizes the challenges of dealing with levels of abstraction. Methodologically, we contribute to the ongoing debate among researchers interested in geometrical data analysis about how to compare fields. Constructing disciplinary spaces of position-takings separately is informative about the internal cognitive structure of disciplines. However, comparing across separately constructed spaces inevitably raises the issue of comparing between different distance scales. Theoretically, we therefore use our empirical material to reflect on what level partial homologies would be found. We combine an informed analysis of the most structuring topics at the disciplinary level with a measure of degree of homology-the Yann score-of the disciplinary structure with the structure of the global space. Our methodology, which infers disciplinary structures from their distribution in a broader space, thus allows us to assess the extent to which each discipline is associated with-or is homologous to-the structure of science.

## 1. Introduction

\[I do not know yet where to put this. I like this intro about topic models\]

Topic modeling is a suite of information retrieval algorithms that has grown popular in sociological applications. Various implementations, including Bayesian inference, semantic networks and neural network-based embeddings have flourished in recent literature. As a dimensionality reduction technique, topic modeling assumes that the content of documents can be described by a finite set of topics, or distributions over vocabulary, which are typically interpretable by domain experts. Sociological applications of topic modeling tend to adopt its operational definition from computer science and information retrieval and, therefore, predominantly revolve around interpreting or discovering particular topics in large corpora. There is consequently a notable scarcity of studies that would develop this method from a distinctively sociological standpoint. Here, we propose to shift the perspective and argue for a sociological appropriation of the method that would focus on the structure of discourse that surfaces in the latent topic space. By highlighting the often overlooked feature of topic models, namely the representation of documents as distribution over topics, we emphasize the intrinsically relational character of topic models. In doing so, we aim to demonstrate how topic models empower sociologists to study the creation of symbolic values and their structuration according to the specific logic of different linguistic markets. The framework of the collective book lends itself perfectly to such task, namely to demonstrate the sociological potential of topic models to uncover homological structures. In this context, we propose to illustrate how the relationality of topic models renders them useful tools for examining homologies between discursive spaces, with empirical evidence from the scientific field.

-   why study homologies in position-takings - in scientific fields

## 2. Homologies in spaces of position-takings: evidence from the scientific field

-   definition

    With reference to Bourdieu, the concept of homology primarily refers to the relationship between positions within a field and the practices (or position-takings) that emerge from those positions (Bourdieu, 1979). This relationship is underpinned by the concept of *habitus*, where personal dispositions associated with agents position, function as structuring principles of action. While much of the sociological literature focuses on homology between positions and position-takings, our focus shifts to *semantic/cognitive spaces*-which, of course, are ultimately grounded in the positions of agents within the scientific field (Wacquant, 1989). These spaces of position-takings reflect the cognitive and epistemological structures that shape how knowledge is produced and legitimized within disciplines.

-   relation of spaces and fields

    In Bourdieu's theory, the scientific field is a subspecies of the larger cultural production field, itself embedded within the broader social space (Bourdieu, 2015). Homology between these spaces implies that the principles of vision and division that govern the field of science are not isolated but related to the larger social structures (Bourdieu, 1996). However, there is also the issue of *relative autonomy*-scientific fields, while influenced by broader social structures, maintain a degree of independence (Bourdieu, 1984). This raises a crucial question: *Are less homologous disciplines necessarily more autonomous?* There is something to explore here. The less homogenous a discipline's principles of vision and division, the more likely it may be to retain its autonomy, carving out its own distinct epistemological and cultural space, jurisdiction, or settlement (Abbott, 2011).

    This relationship between homology and autonomy invites further inquiry, especially in the context of how different disciplines navigate the complex interaction between their own internal logics and the broader societal structures. The editors' focus on homology provides valuable insights, but as sociologists of science, we need to extend this discussion by engaging more critically with the concept of *relative autonomy* and how it shapes the practices and power dynamics within scientific fields. Focusing solely on homology may obscure the dynamics of how disciplines are structured and evolve in relation to the larger social space.

-   The scientific field is highly specific in that it is one of the most autonomous subfields within cultural production, characterized by distinct barriers to entry and a specific set of rules for recognition (Bourdieu, 2001). As a field of action, it is defined by the power of agents to determine the boundaries of what is considered scientific knowledge and valid practices. According to Bourdieu's *Homo Academicus* (1984a), the scientific field operates as a field of symbolic power, where the production and validation of knowledge is a collective activity regulated by the internal logic of the field. While Bourdieu's analysis in *Homo Academicus* is insightful, we should also be cautious of a one-sided interpretation of the field's autonomy. The scientific field, though relatively autonomous, does not operate in a vacuum-its practices and distinctions are shaped by broader social forces, as Wacquant (1989) and Wang (2016) point out.

    \[keep notes - Abbott and topic modeling\]

    Accordingly, scientific fields have often been conceptualized as relatively stable structures serving as fundamental organizational units that structure the production of scientific knowledge. They provide specific schemes of organization, perception and action, ensuring their continuity over time (Whitley, 1984; Lenoir, 1997; Bourdieu, 1997), while also shaping research agendas, establishing standards of evaluation, and governing scientific careers (Heilbron, 2004; Gingras, 2012). These entities are seminally analyzed through their process of autonomization, i.e., the progressive implementation of several institutional markers, such as dedicated journals, scientific societies and events, or academic units. However, this approach alone is likely to fail at identifying the social and cognitive configurations *before* or *after* the integration of disciplinary entities, hence failing to account for the emergence and dissolution of research fields as a processual dynamic. Such a focus on scientific institutions and their relative autonomy vis-à-vis competing fields has accounted for the lion's share of sociological research on science (Bourdieu, 2001; Elias, 2017; Benz et al., 2024). This dominant approach is typically adopting a retrospective, front-to-back perspective, hence reconstructing historical narratives from the established forms of scientific entities, where change may only take place at the borderland of disciplines.

    To overcome these limitations, we propose to switch for a back-to-front perspective, hence starting from the dynamics of boundary formation rather than assuming fixed entities. "**Boundaries come first, then entities**" (Abbott, 1995: 860). In other terms, we examine how micro-level changes, such as shifts in membership and research focus, aggregate into macro-level transformations that shape the trajectory of a field. To examine how scientific fields emerge, merge, endure, or dissolve over time, one must analyze to what extent such initial sites of difference crystallize into durable scientific structures. The introduction of a new boundary has the typical effect of destroying a previous dimension of difference. This means to delegitimize old differences or the emphasis on new ones. The former yokes entities together, the latter divides them. In formal terms, a yoking is defined as "**a projection from a social space of higher dimensionality to one of lower dimensionality**" (Abbott, 1995: 871).

    Hence, instead of starting from assuming the existence of scientific fields as integrated entities, we consider analyzing how bundles of ties between various areas of work and various bodies of workers constitute scientific structures at any given time (Abbott, 1995), and how they relate to institutional markers.

    ### Role of language / linguistic market \[this is for Radim or Yann\]

-   "linguistic market" â€“ how different ways of speaking/writing hold different values within a field

-   symbolic capital - how linguistic choices reflect and shape an actor's position and authority within the field

-   the space of possible position-takings

### Challenges for representing position-takings

-   large volumes of text
-   complexity of capturing meanings in language
-   qualitative methods difficult to map onto quantitative models

### Topic models as tools for position-taking analysis

-   embedding approach
-   probabilistic approach
-   our approach

#### Sociological relevance of topic modeling

\[this is embedded in the previous point, but must be a transition to the results. And also comes again at the end as a discussion/conclusion\]

## Results: study of position-takings in the scientific field

This result section is divided into three parts. *First*, we present the structure of the general topic space, i.e. the donut. *Second*, we show to what degree discipline align with the main principles of opposition-vision and division-of the global space, i.e. the Yann score. *Third*, to illustrate our findings, we focus on two disciplines that exemplify contrasting degrees of homology to the global space: the biological sciences, characterized by high homology, and law, which exhibits low degree of homology.
